Relinux
=======

A free tool to create a professional-looking OS.

As relinux is still being developed, a full README is not a huge priority,
so just head over to the [Installing page](https://github.com/Anonymous Meerkat/relinux/wiki/Installing) of the wiki for a downloading/installing/running guide.
