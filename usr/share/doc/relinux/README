 Relinux

- a script to remaster your Linux distribution easily

For more information, please visit http://relinux.sf.net/


How to configure:
=================
Type this into a Terminal window to generate the configuration file:

  cp /etc/relinux/relinux.conf ./relinux.conf
  sed -i 's:EXCLUDES="\(.*\)":EXCLUDES="\1 '`readlink -f ./relinux.conf`'":g' ./relinux.conf

Then open ./relinux.conf in your favorite text editor, and change the values as you wish.
Some splash images are stored in /etc/relinux/relinux/splash/
When you run the script, make sure that you are in the same directory.

How to use:
===========
Usage is as follows:

  sudo relinux clean [configfile]     -  Cleans the temporary build directory
  sudo relinux fullclean [configfile] -  Fully cleans the temporary build directory (including the ISO file)
  sudo relinux squashfs [configfile]  -  Generates a .squashfs file based on your system
  sudo relinux onlyiso [configfile]   -  Generates a .iso file, using the squashfs file generated by the previous command
  sudo relinux iso [configfile]       -  Runs the last 2 commands
